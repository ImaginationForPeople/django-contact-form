Included views
==============


One view is included with this application:
``contact_form.views.contact_form``, which knows how to work with
``contact_form.forms.ContactForm`` and its subclasses, and takes
several useful keyword arguments for specifying behavior.


``contact_form.views.contact_form``
====================================

Renders a contact form, validates its input and sends an email from
it.

To specify the form class to use, pass the ``form_class`` keyword
argument; if no ``form_class`` is specified, the base ``ContactForm``
class will be used.

To specify the template to use for rendering the form (*not* the
template used to render the email message sent from the form, which is
handled by the form class), pass the ``template_name`` keyword
argument; if not supplied, this will default to
``contact/contact_form.html``.

To specify a URL to redirect to after a successfully-sent message,
pass the ``success_url`` keyword argument; if not supplied, this will
default to ``/contact/sent/``.

To suppress exceptions raised during sending of the email, pass a
``True`` value for the ``fail_silently`` keyword argument. This is
**not** recommended.
    
Template::

    Passed in the ``template_name`` argument.
